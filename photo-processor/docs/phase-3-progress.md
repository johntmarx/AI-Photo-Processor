)
```

## üìà Metrics

### Test Coverage
- Unit Tests: 20/20 (100%)
- All models tested with real images
- GPU optimization verified
- Error handling validated

### Performance
- RT-DETR: ~200ms per image
- SAM2: ~500ms per mask (high quality)
- SigLIP: ~100ms per embedding
- NIMA: ~150ms per assessment
- Qwen2.5-VL: ~2-3s per analysis

### Resource Usage
- GPU Memory: 4-6GB per model
- All models support dynamic loading
- Efficient batch processing ready

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Recipe Schema Design**
   - Draft enhanced schema with AI fields
   - Add validation for AI parameters
   - Design variable substitution system

2. **Model Manager Implementation**
   - Create service for model lifecycle
   - Implement memory management
   - Add health checks

3. **API Extensions**
   - New endpoints for model queries
   - Recipe validation with AI steps
   - Model capability endpoints

### Next Week
1. **Full Pipeline Integration**
   - Connect models to processor
   - Implement orchestration
   - Add progress tracking

2. **UI Updates**
   - Model selection in recipe editor
   - Prompt template builder
   - AI parameter controls

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - End-to-end AI pipeline tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - User documentation

## üö® Blockers & Risks

### Current
- None - all models working independently

### Potential
- GPU memory constraints with multiple models
- Model loading time for first inference
- Complexity of recipe conditional logic

### Mitigation
- Implement model pooling/sharing
- Pre-load frequently used models
- Start with simple conditionals

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Standalone Components**: Each AI model is self-contained for easier testing and maintenance
2. **GPU Enforcement**: Base class ensures all models use GPU for consistency
3. **Ollama Integration**: Qwen2.5-VL uses existing Ollama service rather than standalone
4. **Structured Outputs**: All models return consistent, typed responses

### Lessons Learned
1. Modern transformers models are much easier to integrate than older versions
2. GPU memory management is critical for multiple models
3. Structured outputs (Pydantic) greatly improve reliability
4. Separate docker-compose files reduce complexity

### Near-Duplicate Detection Note
User mentioned this use case: "Photos taken in rapid succession - select the 'BEST' photo"
- SigLIP can compute similarity between images
- NIMA can rank quality
- Combination enables automatic best shot selection
- Added to roadmap for recipe templates
