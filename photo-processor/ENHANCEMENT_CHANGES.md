# Enhancement System Updates

## Overview
The enhancement system has been simplified to focus on core color and tonal adjustments only, removing content-modifying features like sharpening and noise reduction as requested.

## Philosophy
Enhance the fundamental properties of images without modifying content. Focus on:
- Color correction
- Tonal adjustments
- Histogram optimization
- Levels and curves

## Core Enhancement Features

### 1. White Balance Correction
- Statistical correction in LAB color space
- Illuminant estimation using bright and gray pixel analysis
- Conservative correction factors to prevent color casts

### 2. Exposure Optimization
- Reinhard tone mapping with local adaptation
- Bilateral filtering for base/detail separation
- Preserves natural lighting while optimizing exposure

### 3. Contrast Enhancement
- Guided filter-based separation (preserves edges)
- Sigmoid contrast curves for smooth enhancement
- Subtle CLAHE as finishing touch only

### 4. Vibrance Adjustment
- Smart saturation that protects skin tones
- HSV color space manipulation
- Natural color enhancement without oversaturation

### 5. Shadow/Highlight Recovery
- Luminosity masks for targeted adjustments
- Smooth feathered transitions
- Recovers detail without haloing or artifacts

## Removed Features
- **Sharpening**: No unsharp masking or edge enhancement
- **Noise Reduction**: No denoising or grain reduction

## Usage

### Intelligent Mode
Uses optimized default settings with conservative strength multipliers:
```python
settings = enhancer.create_default_intelligent_settings(strength=1.0)
```

### Custom Mode
Individual control over each enhancement feature:
```python
custom_settings = EnhancementSettings(
    white_balance=True,
    white_balance_strength=0.8,
    exposure=True,
    exposure_strength=1.0,
    contrast=True,
    contrast_strength=0.7,
    vibrance=True,
    vibrance_strength=1.2,
    shadow_highlight=True,
    shadow_highlight_strength=0.9,
    overall_strength=1.0
)
```

## Testing
Run the test script to see individual enhancement features:
```bash
docker compose exec photo_processor python test_core_enhancement.py
```

This will generate examples of each enhancement feature applied individually and combined.
